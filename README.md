## Hi there I am Jhansi Patnala👋

**Data Engineer | Turning Raw Data Into Meaningful Impact | Cloud Enthusiast | Builder of Smart Pipelines | Open to Opportunities**

**🌟 About Me**

_Welcome to my GitHub! I build scalable, clean, and reliable data pipelines with **3 years** of experience delivering solutions across healthcare, NGO, automotive, and retail industries_

---

🌱 I believe in **data that heals, empowers, and transforms lives**. From optimizing NGO program analytics in USA/Uganda to enabling real-time oncology insights for cancer patients, I’ve seen the power of engineering thoughtful, reliable, and ethical data systems.

🎓 I hold a Master’s in Management Information Systems from the University at Buffalo, where I specialized in **, Data Warehousing, Data Modeling, Data Analytics and Data Management**. My academic journey was guided by purpose — to turn raw data into stories that support decision-making and drive real impact.

🔧 Whether it's designing 15 TB/day ETL pipelines, automating HIPAA-compliant clinical workflows, or scaling streaming systems for real-time fraud detection — **I bring both skill and soul to the craft** of data engineering.
